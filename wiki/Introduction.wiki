#This will serve as the place holder on how to effectively use the tool.

= Introduction =

Pinata was developed to assist with the explanation of the Cross-Site Request Forgery and how a vulnerable application can be exploited - this is often useful when you are trying to explain to the client that their application is susceptible to this particular class of vulnerability. Of course, this was in response to the somewhat peculiar behavior of how this vulnerability works.

Once a tester identifies a function as vulnerable, she can use this tool to create a proof of concept HTML, perhaps modify it and play it against the vulnerable system to confirm the vulnerability. It also helps in the identification of ineffective CSRF protection whereby the application uses the same CSRF token for different sessions or does not invalidate previous CSRF tokens. 

To effectively use the tool, one should know what and how Cross-Site Request Forgery works. You can find my detail write up CSRF on the project Home page under my blog. You should also have access to a proxy tool. Burp, Paros, Webscarb, any proxy will do, as long as you can capture the raw HTTP request. Also, you should have access to the application you are testing, and of course, you must have explicit permission from the owner of the application to check it.
